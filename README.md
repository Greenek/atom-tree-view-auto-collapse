# Tree View Auto-Collapse

Helps to keep the tree view clean and clear by collapsing currently unused entries. 

## Installation

Open **Settings** → **Install** and search for `tree-view-auto-collapse` or install through command-line:

	apm install tree-view-auto-collapse
  
Make sure to restart Atom after the package is installed.
  
### Optional Setup
  
  * Package works the best with `Auto Reveal` and `Focus on Reveal` options enabled (**Packages** → **tree-view**).
  * Works even better with [ZenTabs](https://atom.io/packages/zentabs) package installed.
  
## Usage

There are two modes you can use:

  * **Default:** Automatically clean tree view after closing a text editor tab (you can disable this behaviour in **Packages** → **tree-view-auto-collapse** → **Auto-Collapse on Editor Tab Closing**).
  * Invoke manually using command `tree-view-auto-collapse:clean-up`.
